title: Downscaling Fit For Purpose
permalink: /research/project3/
---

Organizations planning for climate change need to use climate models to assess risks, but face an overwhelming number of choices when selecting downscaled climate data. There's no universal "best method" because different downscaling approaches have varying strengths, and different climate risks require different considerations. The goal of this work is to create practical guidance to help risk managers make better-informed adaptation decisions by determining which climate projection tools are truly "fit for purpose" for their specific needs.
