title: Projections of Atmospheric Circulation
permalink: /research/project1/
---

Climate models predict that by the end of this century, the Pacific Northwest will experience similar winter weather patterns as today, but summer patterns will show weaker atmospheric circulation. Summer weather patterns with strong atmospheric pressure differences will become less frequent. In winter, historically cold patterns will warm the most, while summer will see the greatest warming inland. Most areas will get wetter overall, though some currently rainy summer patterns may become significantly drier.
