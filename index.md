## West Coast Rain Onset and Wildfire

The West Coast of the US typically experiences cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers, with a transitional period between seasons that brings an increased risk of both strong winds and significant rain. This transition coincides with dangerously dry vegetation, creating high wildfire risk when strong winds arrive before rain. This work using dynamically downscaled CMIP6 model to analyze changes in the timing of rain onset and the timing of wind onset. Models project that by the end of the century under SSP370, strong winds will occur later in the season, and the first significant rainfall will also be delayed, though not as much as the winds. While there may be fewer instances where wind arrives before rain, the longer dry season will likely lead to drier vegetation, potentially affecting wildfire risk.

## Projections of Atmospheric Circulation

Climate models predict that by the end of this century, the Pacific Northwest will experience similar winter weather patterns as today, but summer patterns will show weaker atmospheric circulation. Summer weather patterns with strong atmospheric pressure differences will become less frequent. In winter, historically cold patterns will warm the most, while summer will see the greatest warming inland. Most areas will get wetter overall, though some currently rainy summer patterns may become significantly drier.

## Downscaling Fit-For-Purpose

Organizations planning for climate change need to use climate models to assess risks, but face an overwhelming number of choices when selecting downscaled climate data. There’s no universal “best method” because different downscaling approaches have varying strengths, and different climate risks require different considerations. The goal of this work is to create practical guidance to help risk managers make better-informed adaptation decisions by determining which climate tools are truly “fit for purpose” for their specific needs.
