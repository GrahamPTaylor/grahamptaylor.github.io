    <p style="margin: 0;">I am a researcher at Cornell University, previously a postdoc working at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics laboratory. I am interested in extreme weather and climate change, atmospheric circulation, wildfire weather, and downscaling. Prior to my postdoc, I received my PhD from Portland State University. My dissertation was titled "Atmospheric Circulation, Climate Change, and Related Impacts Over the Western United States".
