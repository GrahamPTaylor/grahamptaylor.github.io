I am a UCAR postdoctoral scholar, working at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics laboratory. I am interested in weather and climate change, atmospheric circulation, wildfire weather, and downscaling. My research projects can be seen on my research page. 

Prior to my postdoc, I received my PhD from Portland State University. My dissertation was titled "Atmospheric Circulation, Climate Change, and Related Impacts Over the Western United States".
